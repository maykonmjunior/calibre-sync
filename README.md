# calibre-sync

Creates a docker app to run calibre-web

The goal is to deploy it using Render (https://dashboard.render.com)

Then, using your own account, you will have access to a perpetually running server,
alowing you to have access to Calibre Web always.

The main credits go for the Calibre Desktop App
- https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/calibre-bin

And for the Calibre Web Project
- https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web

Also, since the Render Free-Tier storage is small,
Better use the Google Drive Integration of Calibre Web
